    <p>Contributors

        Git (in a git repository) identifies authors and committers by email address. Github users can associate email addresses with their accounts. When a user's set of email addresses is found in the commit history of a github repo, github marks that user as a contributor.
        
        GH Enterprise docs seem to be consistent with contributors only being associated with email addresses.
        Collaborators
        
        A user that has defined permissions in a github repo is marked as a collaborator. These permissions can vary and do not need to be the commit bit. A random org I am a member of shows the following options presently:
        
            read
            write
            admin
            issue triage
            non-admin manager
        
        See also gh enterprise docs.
        
        A user who has read-only access to a private repo should be marked as a collaborator, in my understanding.</p>
